What is the meaning of the data?
================================

There are three files in total: all\_data_tidy.txt, mean\_by\_activity.txt and mean\_by\_subject.txt

In all\_data\_tidy.txt, the columns are as follows:
(1) "activity", indicating what type of activity the subject is taking (i.e. standing, sitting, etc.).
(2) "subject", indicating the subject.
(3) "body\_acc\_x\_ave" through "total\_acc\_z\_sd", indicating the averages and standard deviations of all measurements.
(4) Others are the features.

In mean\_by\_activity.txt and mean\_by\_subject.txt, the first column is the activity type or the subject, respectively. The rest columns are the means by activity (or subject) of all columns described above, except activity and subject themselves.
